Hey there!

I’m super excited to kick off a new learning journey where I’ll be diving deep into the **core computer science concepts** that really shape how everything in tech works. While I’ve been a software developer for a while now, I want to go back to the basics and understand the inner workings of things like algorithms, memory management, compilers, and distributed systems — all through hands-on projects and practice problems.

### What’s Driving This Journey?

For me, the best way to really **understand** something is by doing it. That's why I’m focusing on **practical learning** — solving problems, building things, and tackling real-world challenges. Along the way, I’ll be learning a ton about **computer science fundamentals** and getting my hands dirty in projects that stretch my skills.

I also believe that **sharing** what I’m learning along the way will help me understand everything even more deeply. Explaining topics to others really forces you to solidify your own understanding, and it’s one of the best ways to remember complex concepts. That’s why I’m excited to share this journey with you all — as I learn, I’ll also be reflecting, explaining, and reinforcing those lessons.

### The Projects I’m Working On

Here are some of the cool projects I’ll be working on during this journey:

- **Alcor**: A programming language that I’m building from scratch. I’m using it as an excuse to dive deep into **compilers**, **interpreters**, and how programming languages are designed. It’s gonna be messy, but fun!
    
- **DIY MTB Suspension Telemetry Toolkit**: Yep, this one's a bit different. I’m working on creating a telemetry system for mountain bike suspension. It’s all about gathering real-time data, combining **hardware** and **software**, and making a custom solution for the MTB world.
    
- **Distributed Serverless System**: I’ve always been curious about distributed systems, and this project is all about building a **serverless system**. It’s gonna be my way of exploring **cloud infrastructure** and how to scale things without the traditional server setup.
    

### But That’s Not All!

These projects are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot more I have planned — and I’ll be sharing the full learning program a little later on. The idea is to gradually build my knowledge, layer by layer, and document everything along the way.

This blog will be my space to share **progress updates**, **milestones**, **research findings**, and anything else I discover on this path. I’ll talk about the **theory**, the **struggles**, and the **solutions** that come up during my projects. If you’re into computer science, tech, or just want to see how a big learning journey unfolds, stay tuned!

Thanks for joining me — more updates coming soon!
