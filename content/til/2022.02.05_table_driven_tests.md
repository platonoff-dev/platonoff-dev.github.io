This trick is very useful if you are using TDD. 
From time to time there is a lot of duplication in our tests. For each test case only the input, the expected output, and name of test case change. Everything else is boilerplate. What wes'd like to set up all the inputs and expected outputs and feel them to a single test harness.
```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct{
		input interface{}
		expected interface{}
		name string
	}{
		// Your test cases here
	}
	
	for _, tc := range tests {
		t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			// Your test logic here
		})
	}
}
```

Also this tests can be ran in parallel:
```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	t.Parallel()
	tests := []struct{
		input interface{}
		expected interface{}
		name string
	}{
		// Your test cases here
	}
	
	for _, tc := range tests {
		t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			// Your test logic here
		})
	}
}
```
