&lt;p>Creating a programming language has always been a fascinating challenge, one that combines creativity with technical depth. Alcor is my experiment in this realm—a project where I explore language design, compilers, and interpreters while deepening my understanding of how programming tools work. The journey is one of discovery, frustration, and, most importantly, immense satisfaction. Through Alcor, I aim to learn not just about making a language but also about the decisions, trade-offs, and artistry behind them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog Kick Off</title><link>https://me.platonoff.dev/posts/blog-kick-off/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://me.platonoff.dev/posts/blog-kick-off/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m super excited to kick off a new learning journey where I’ll be diving deep into the &lt;strong>core computer science concepts&lt;/strong> that really shape how everything in tech works. While I’ve been a software developer for a while now, I want to go back to the basics and understand the inner workings of things like algorithms, memory management, compilers, and distributed systems — all through hands-on projects and practice problems.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
