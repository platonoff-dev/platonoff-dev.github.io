I’m super excited to kick off a new learning journey where I’ll be diving deep into the core computer science concepts that really shape how everything in tech works.

While I’ve been a software developer for a while now, I want to go back to the basics and understand the inner workings of things like algorithms, memory management, compilers, and distributed systems — all through hands-on projects and practice problems.\nWhat’s Driving This Journey? For me, the best way to really understand something is by doing it. That’s why I’m focusing on practical learning — solving problems, building things, and tackling real-world challenges. Along the way, I’ll be learning a ton about computer science fundamentals and getting my hands dirty in projects that stretch my skills.\nI also believe that sharing what I’m learning along the way will help me understand everything even more deeply. Explaining topics to others really forces you to solidify your own understanding, and it’s one of the best ways to remember complex concepts. That’s why I’m excited to share this journey with you all — as I learn, I’ll also be reflecting, explaining, and reinforcing those lessons.\nThe Projects I’m Working On Here are some of the cool projects I’ll be working on during this journey:\nAlcor: A programming language that I’m building from scratch. I’m using it as an excuse to dive deep into compilers, interpreters, and how programming languages are designed. It’s gonna be messy, but fun!\nDIY MTB Suspension Telemetry Toolkit: Yep, this one’s a bit different. I’m working on creating a telemetry system for mountain bike suspension. It’s all about gathering real-time data, combining hardware and software, and making a custom solution for the MTB world.\nDistributed Serverless System: I’ve always been curious about distributed systems, and this project is all about building a serverless system. It’s gonna be my way of exploring cloud infrastructure and how to scale things without the traditional server setup.\nBut That’s Not All! These projects are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot more I have planned — and I’ll be sharing the full learning program a little later on. The idea is to gradually build my knowledge, layer by layer, and document everything along the way.\nThis blog will be my space to share progress updates, milestones, research findings, and anything else I discover on this path. I’ll talk about the theory, the struggles, and the solutions that come up during my projects. If you’re into computer science, tech, or just want to see how a big learning journey unfolds, stay tuned!\nThanks for joining me — more updates coming soon!\n","wordCount":"441","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-12-08T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://me.platonoff.dev/posts/blog-kick-off/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Anatolii Platonov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://me.platonoff.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://me.platonoff.dev/ accesskey=h title="Anatolii Platonov (Alt + H)">Anatolii Platonov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://me.platonoff.dev/posts title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Blog Kick Off</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Hey there!</p><p>I’m super excited to kick off a new learning journey where I’ll be diving deep into the <strong>core computer science concepts</strong> that really shape how everything in tech works.
